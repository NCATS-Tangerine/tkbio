These are just some basic notes about *manual* deployment of KB2 
to an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu, directly as a Spring Boot Jar. 
Note that WAR deployment to, say, a Tomcat Web Application container, 
is likely more robust for production deployment, and thus, to be preferred.

1. Ensure that all the system software is updated (sudo apt-get update / upgrade)

2. Ensure that Neo4j is installed (sudo apt-get install neo4j). 
   Ensure that the dbms.connector.http.address=0.0.0.0 is uncommented in /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf.
   Start up the server(?) and (remotely, from your machine) load the server with some (sample) data(?).

3. Ensure that NGINX is installed (if you wish to proxy the server). Check that proxy settings are pointing to the localhost:8080 where KB2 will run.

4. Git clone the KB2 source tree somewhere convenient (e.g. in /opt).

5. gradle --refresh-dependancies clean install

6. *Manually* add the VAADIN themes folder, from /kb2/web/src/webapp, to the /kb2/web/build/libs/web*.jar # Note: not yet sure how to automate this part

7. (Optionally) put a symbolic link (kb2.jar?) to the jar in user home(?)

8.  Run the software: jar -jar kb2.jar >kb2_`date -I`.out 2>&1 &

9. Make sure that the AWS firewall is open up to your machine... go to the site...
