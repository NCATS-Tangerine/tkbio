#generate.sh#

The 'generate.sh' script can be used to update or regenerate the tkbio client
code accessing the beacon-aggregator. 

Type the script name without any arguments to get the usage. Note that for TKBio,
we only need to generate the client code.

The client API specification is in the spec/knowledge-beacon-api.yaml file. 

After regenerating the client code, you need to fix the functions in the KnowledgeBeaconService
of the bio.knowledge.service.beacon package in the 'core' subproject.
