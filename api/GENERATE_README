#generate.sh#

The 'generate.sh' script can be used to update or regenerate the tkbio client
code accessing the beacon-aggregator. 

Type the script name without any arguments to get the usage. Note that for TKBio,
we only need to generate the client code.

The client API specification is in the spec/beacon-aggregator-api.yaml file.
This specification is generally identical to the one in the actual 
beacon-aggregator project, except for the various 'title' fields used
in generating data transfer objects. These are renamed from 'Server' to 'Beacon' prefixes
with some internal name changes to suit as well, to ensure that generated classes
don't have a direct name conflict with the main TKBIO model classes.

After regenerating the client code, you need to fix the functions in the KnowledgeBeaconService
of the bio.knowledge.service.beacon package in the 'core' subproject.
