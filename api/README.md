# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview 
 
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  

This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Build the server into an executable Java JAR file by using Maven:

	mvn package

The resulting JAR is placed into the 'target' subdirectory.

Start your server as an simple java application, something like

	java -jar target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar 

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
  
	http://localhost:8080/api
