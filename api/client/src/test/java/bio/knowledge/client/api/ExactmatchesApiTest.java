 * Translator Knowledge Beacon API
 * This is the Translator Knowledge Beacon web service application programming interface (API).  This OpenAPI (\"Swagger\") document may be used as the input specification into a tool like [Swagger-Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/README.md) to generate client and server code stubs implementing the API, in any one of several supported computer languages and frameworks. In order to customize usage to your web site, you should change the 'host' directive below to your hostname.  Note that where the term 'local' is used below to describe an identifier or other resource, it is referring to the specific Knowledge Source (KS) upon which the Knowledge Beacon API is hosted.
