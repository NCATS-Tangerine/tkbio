welcome_text=The Global Timber Tracking Network (GTTN) database is a scientific database to monitor legal timber trade and curb illegal and unsustainable logging. The general information section of the database is open to the public but access to the database itself is only for authorized users.
welcome_text_para1=The Global Timber Tracking Network (GTTN) database is a scientific database to monitor legal timber trade and curb illegal and unsustainable logging. The general information section of the database is open to the public but access to the database itself is only for authorized users.
welcome_text_para2=The GTTN database provides information that will help you for (1) species identification and (2) the verification of the origin (country, region, concession) of wood and wood products along the supply chain.
welcome_text_para3=The GTTN database will guide you on the available scientific methods and tools (genetics, stable isotopes and wood anatomy), and will direct you to the certified labs able to analyse your samples.

#about page
about_h3=About the {0}
about_text=The "Global Timber Tracking Network" (GTTN) is a global platform for global coordination in the development and use of innovative methods for type and origin determination of wood (fingerprint with genetic markers and isotope method) with the aim of curbing the illegal and unsustainable logging all around the world. For this purpose, the knowledge sharing and networking between research projects, public authorities and other key actors will be promoted. Furthermore, it is maintaining a global online database of georeferenced DNA and isotope data for important species. The database is a crucial prerequisite to make available to the world's present data for the application of the methods by industry, academia and regulatory authorities
